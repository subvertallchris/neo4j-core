# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This file should follow the standards specified on [http://keepachangelog.com/]
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [6.1.2] - 2016-02-02

### Fixed

- Returning paths within transactions in Server mode could result in incorrectly wrapped nodes.

### Changed

- The process of parsing responses from the transactional endpoint was simplified and improved. A few methods tied directly to the old implementation and with no reusability were removed. See https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core/pull/249 for changes.

## [6.1.0] - 2016-01-01

### Fixed

- There is no longer a need to know about / use the `WITHOUT_NEO4J_EMBEDDED` environment variable if you want to use server mode in jRuby.
- Node and relationship objects can now be marshaled

## [6.0.4] - 2015-12-22

### Fixed

- Reverted thread fix from 6.0.2 because I didn't quite know what I was doing.  Will tackle it again later...

## [6.0.3] - 2015-12-21

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where there was a need to `require 'neo4j/core/cypher_session'` (see #224)

## [6.0.2] - 2015-12-18

### Fixed

- Make sessions thread-safe

## [6.0.1] - 2015-12-10

## Fixed

- Make sure that limit only gets shifted if it directly follows a `with` or `order`

### [6.0.0] - 2015-11-24

- No changes from rc.1

## [6.0.0.rc.1] - 2015-11-13

This release contains no changes since the last alpha. Below are all modifications introduced in alpha releases.

### Changed

- Depends on `neo4j-rake_tasks` ~> 0.3.0.
- Removed `Neo4j::Session#on_session_available`, replaced with `Neo4j::Session#on_next_session_available`. The new method will empty its queue as it is played.
- Refactored `Neo4j::Label#create_index` and `Neo4j::Label#create_constraint` to have compatible signatures. As part of the refactoring of `Neo4j::Label#creator_index`, the method no longer accepts multiple properties. The method will need to be called once for each, when needed.

### Added

- New session, adaptors, and rewritten Node, Relationship, and Path classes. They are not yet in use but are part of ongoing refactoring and rebuilding.

(There are probably other changes too!)

**Changes above this point should conform to [http://keepachangelog.com/]**

## [v4.1.0]
* A lot of work working with rubocop to clean up code
* Many instances of using strings were changed to use symbols
* Certain query responses are now automatically retried
* `Neo4j::Core::Query` changes
* WHERE clauses from `Query` chains are now surrounded by parentheses to avoid problems
* WHERE clauses now support Arrays and `nil` values for labels
* WHERE clauses with strings now support a second argument for parameters.  Examples:
  * `where("foo = {bar}", bar: value)`)
  * `where("foo = ?", value)`)
* REMOVE clauses now quote labels and support arrays to specify all labels
and properties for one variable
* RETURN clauses now turn `:neo_id` into `ID(var)`
* New method `#clause?` lets you determine if a `Query` object had a
clause called upon it in the past
* New method `#count` lets you query a count of a variable


## [v4.0.0]
This release focuses mostly on performance and security.
* Fixed a few n+1 queries, force the use of params in more common locations.
* The CypherTransaction class was heavily refactored to improve the number of database connections required per transaction. This may be considered a breaking API change. Using `Neo4j::Transaction.new` or `Neo4j::Transaction.run` as instructed in all docs and examples protects the user from this, so there should be no changes required to old code in most cases.
* New Rake task: `neo4j:start_no_wait` -- thanks, @telzul!
* Massive refactoring and general cleanup by Brian.

## [3.1.1]
* Force more basic, common queries to use params. Early benchmarks suggest big performance improvements.
* Auth improvements. You can now use a valid Neo4j token with any username to authenticate.

## [3.1.0]
* Swapped out `START n=node...` for `MATCH (n) WHERE ID(n)...` for compatibility with Neo4j 2.2.
* Added a new class, CypherAuthentication, to support Neo4j 2.2's new authentication endpoint.
* Modified the `neo4j:install` rake task to disable authentication in Neo4j 2.2.
* New rake tasks that do exactly what you expect: `neo4j:enable_auth`, `neo4j:disable_auth`, `neo4j:change_password`. All 2.2 only, of course.
* Travis-CI will run against its MRI specs against Neo4j 2.2 with Ruby 2.1.5.
* Use params for all `create` actions to improve performance and security.
* More tweaks to the string escaping process.
* Mild refactoring for DRY and performance.

## [3.0.8]
* Small bugfix. Releasing so neo4jrb/neo4j doesn't need to pull from master in its new release.

## [3.0.7]
* Move improved escaping of Cypher params

## [3.0.6]
* When using Neo4j >= 2.1.5, use the metadata keys in Cypher responses to find labels when loading nodes
* Adds `version` method to Embedded and Server sessions
* Improved escaping of Cypher params

## [3.0.5]
* Bug fix: automatic parsing of basic auth params in URL (Thanks, Miha Rekar!)
* Adds find_in_batches method, see github wiki for documentation: https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core/wiki

## [3.0.4]
* Bug fixes to sanitize params and remove blank clauses

## [3.0.3]
* Adds a user agent string to connections to identify the driver with the server

## [3.0.2]
* Improved detection of transaction responses to prevent conflicts with property names

## [3.0.1]
* Improved handling of cypher responses, particularly within transactions
